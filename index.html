## Introduction

Welcome to my website. It's currently in its early stages and hopefully will become more detailed with time.

I am a 4th year integrated Masters Physics and Computer Science student at Durham University.
Currently I use this site to share blog posts about my experiences with the excellent Fast.ai course. They can be found below. 
When my Machine learning based Masters project starts, I will also include posts regarding its progression.
