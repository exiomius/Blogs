## Introduction

Welcome to my website. It's currently in its early stages and hopefully will become more detailed with time.

My name is Adnan, I'm a 4th year integrated Masters Physics and Computer Science student at Durham University.
Currently I use this site to share blog posts about my various technical projects. 
On the top-right, click on "Projects" to see them organised by tag and date. 
Otherwise, below this text is a list of posts sorted by most recent, but bear in mind often the most recent posts are not yet completed.
